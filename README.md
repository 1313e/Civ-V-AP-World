## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options. 

### Where do I get a YAML file?
In the archipelago launcher use the generate template options and select the Civilization V yaml.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Open the CivV Client in the AP launcher and connect to the archipelago server after starting a Civilization V game and creating a city. 
  - After connecting you may need to open a menu to actually cause connection to occur like the social policies menu. *Looking into possible fix*

To connect the client to the multiserver simply put `<address>:<port>` on the textfield on top and press enter (if the
server uses password, type in the bottom textfield `/connect <address>:<port> [password]`)
